# A-Social-Relationship-Awareness-Based-Dependent-Task-Offloading-Algorithm-for-Mobile-Edge-Computing
This study proposes a novel task offloading algorithm that comprehensively considers various
 factors including a symmetric social relationships among users, task dependencies,
energy consumption, and latency. Specifically, this paper introduces the social affinity
between devices and task categories as a supplement to the traditional objective functions
(focused on energy consumption and latency) to optimize the task offloading process.
The article extensively discusses task offloading decisions under four modes (local execution,
Device-to-Device (D2D) execution, edge execution, and D2D-edge mixed execution),
providing comprehensive analysis and modeling in terms of energy consumption,
latency, social affinity, and task dependencies for each mode. The Hungarian algorithm
is utilized for global optimization to enhance the overall performance of the system. The
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through experiments, and the specific
 impact of task data size on offloading strategies in different scenarios is analyzed,
including personal mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) environments, data centers,
and intelligent vehicles.
